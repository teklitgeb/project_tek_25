## Course Overview

During this one-day course, we will build on open-source foundations, focusing 
on [Brightway](https://github.com/brightway-lca), and [Activity Browser](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser). Additional course material for [Wurst](https://github.com/polca/wurst), [Premise](https://github.com/polca/premise) and [ODYM](https://github.com/IndEcol/ODYM), 
is also provided. These tools help to perform LCA studies and to make our inventory models better fit research questions with a temporal 
dimension. The instructor will be:

- **Romain Sacchi**: Developer of [Premise](https://github.com/polca/premise), [Pathways](https://github.com/polca/pathways) and [Carculator](https://github.com/Laboratory-for-Energy-Systems-Analysis/carculator)

The course will cover [Brightway](https://docs.brightway.dev/en/latest/)’s basics and best practices for model development, 
including the use of Jupyter notebooks and the [Activity Browser](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser). 
Essential LCA aspects such as importing inventories from Excel, calculating LCIA results, sensitivity analysis, multiple types of 
uncertainty, or parametrization, will be taught. 

This repository also includes tutorials guiding the use of [ODYM](https://github.com/IndEcol/ODYM) for combining LCA with Material Flow Analysis (MFA), 
the use of [Wurst](https://github.com/polca/wurst) for consistent manipulation of LCA inventories, and [premise](https://premise.readthedocs.io) 
for the creation of prospective, IPCC scenario-based ecoinvent versions.

## Course Structure
This one-day course will consist of lectures together with hands-on exercises.

## Target Audience
This course is aimed at students and researchers who wish to become familiar with 
the Brightway ecosystem, specifically targeting beginner and intermediate 
users. 

> [!NOTE]
> While Python proficiency is not required, we recommend that participants go through some basic Python tutorials before the course.


## Contact

In case of issue going through the instructions, please contact the [organizing team](mailto:romain.sacchi@psi.ch).


## Instructions Before the Course
Ideally, do this **at least one week before the course starts**, 
so that you have time to ask/write us questions if you encounter any issues.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Please read the [INSTRUCTIONS.MD](INSTRUCTIONS.MD) file in this repository to get yourself ready before the course.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> To go through the instructions, you will need ecoinvent credentials (username and password).

Obviously, please bring your laptop and charger with you.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We recommend to have at least 8GB of RAM on your computer, as some of the calculations can 
> be quite memory-intensive.
