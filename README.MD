## Course Overview

During this one-day course, we will build on open-source foundations, focusing 
on [Brightway](https://github.com/brightway-lca). Additional course material for [Wurst](https://github.com/polca/wurst), [Premise](https://github.com/polca/premise) and [ODYM](https://github.com/IndEcol/ODYM), 
is also provided, but will not be looked at during the course. These tools help to perform LCA studies 
and to make our inventory models better fit research questions with a temporal 
dimension. 

The instructor will be:

- **Romain Sacchi**: Developer of [Premise](https://github.com/polca/premise), [Pathways](https://github.com/polca/pathways), [Carculator](https://github.com/Laboratory-for-Energy-Systems-Analysis/carculator), and [Edges](https://github.com/Laboratory-for-Energy-Systems-Analysis/edges).

The course will cover [Brightway](https://docs.brightway.dev/en/latest/)â€™s basics and best practices for model development, 
including the use of Jupyter notebooks and [Activity Browser](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser). 
Essential LCA aspects such as importing inventories from Excel, calculating LCIA results, sensitivity analysis, multiple types of 
uncertainty, or parametrization, as well as data sharing, will be taught. 

This repository also includes, among others, tutorials guiding the use of [ODYM](https://github.com/IndEcol/ODYM) 
for combining LCA with Material Flow Analysis (MFA), 
the use of [Wurst](https://github.com/polca/wurst) for consistent manipulation of LCA inventories, and [premise](https://premise.readthedocs.io) 
for the creation of prospective, IPCC scenario-based ecoinvent versions.

## Course Structure
This one-day course will consist of lectures together with hands-on exercises.

## Target Audience
This course is aimed at students and researchers who wish to become familiar with 
the Brightway ecosystem, specifically targeting beginner and intermediate 
users. 

> [!NOTE]
> While Python proficiency is not required, we recommend that participants 
> go through some basic Python tutorials before the course.


## Contact

In case of issue going through the instructions, please contact 
the [organizing team](mailto:romain.sacchi@psi.ch).


## Instructions Before the Course
Ideally, do this **at least one week before the course starts**, 
so that you have time to ask/write us questions if you encounter any issues.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Please read the [INSTRUCTIONS.MD](INSTRUCTIONS.MD) file in this repository to get 
> yourself ready before the course.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> To go through the instructions, you will need ecoinvent credentials 
> (username and password).

Obviously, please bring your laptop and charger with you.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We recommend to have at least 8GB of RAM on your computer, as some of the 
> calculations can be memory-intensive.
